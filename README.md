Idea: Etchasketch

Method: 
Create a grid, likely with 2d arrays
toggle whether you're drawing
select which character to draw with
each movement checks the new coordinate for a character matching the drawing
if the character matches: good
if the character doesn't match: overwrite with the new drawing character


support mid-draw toggling and selection
